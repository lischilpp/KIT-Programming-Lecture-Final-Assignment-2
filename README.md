# KIT Programming Lecture Final Assignment 2

This project is my personal solution for the the final assignment no. 2 of the KIT Programming Lecture 2018/19.

It implements a system for material requirements planning in companies, based on bills of materials that are composed of individual parts and assemblies.

All code that was provided by the exercise and not authored by me has been removed or replaced.
